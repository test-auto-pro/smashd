# Content Checklist: Post to 9 Platforms PRO
*Combining George Kao's Authentic Principles with Focused Product Marketing*

- [ ] **No scope creep** - not teaching HeyGen, Blotato features beyond publishing, or general automation

---

## Before Creating Content

### Intention Check (George Kao)
- [ ] **Is my intention clear?** (Nurture OR Sell - not both in same piece)
- [ ] **Am I creating to serve, or to manipulate?**
- [ ] **Does this help people see a solution to their problem?**

### Content Purpose
- [ ] This content helps audience **learn** what's possible with automation
- [ ] This content helps audience **feel** positive, hopeful, inspired to try
- [ ] This content shows how to **get all the results from free content marketing** (reach, consistency, leads, sales) **with the least amount of effort**

## Creating the Content

### George Kao's Principles Applied

#### Avoid "Lizard Brain" Marketing
- [ ] **NO fear-based language** ("You're doing it wrong!", "Stop wasting time!")
- [ ] **NO FOMO tactics** ("Limited spots!", "Don't miss out!", "Act now!")
- [ ] **NO anxiety triggers** ("You're falling behind!", "Everyone else is doing this!")
- [ ] **NO fake urgency** for evergreen offers
- [ ] **NO manipulation** - no guilt, shame, or pressure

#### Gentle, Solution-Focused Hooks Instead
- [ ] **Possibility-focused**: "Here's what's possible..."
- [ ] **Solution-oriented**: "This solves the problem of..."
- [ ] **Hopeful tone**: "See how this could help..."
- [ ] **Factual demonstration**: "Watch what happens when..."
- [ ] **Empowering**: Audience makes free choice, not manipulated into buying

### Authentic Expression
- [ ] **Speaking authentically** - not copying fear-based hooks even if they're viral
- [ ] **Honest about what the system does AND doesn't do**
- [ ] **Clear about being automated content** (if using AI avatars/generated content)
- [ ] **Transparent about the business model** - selling automation setup

### Transparency
- [ ] **Clear whether this is educational or promotional**
- [ ] **If selling**: stating plainly what I'm offering and for whom
- [ ] **If educating**: pure value, no hidden sales pitch
- [ ] **Honest about limitations** of the system

### Service-Oriented Approach
- [ ] **Content provides value even if they never buy**
- [ ] **Focused on solving their problem**, not just my business goals
- [ ] **Empowers their choice** rather than diminishing it
- [ ] **Shows respect for their time and intelligence**

## For Promotional Content (Gentle Launch: 2 Messages Max)

### Message 1: Humble Offering
- [ ] **What I've built**: Post to 9 Platforms PRO automation
- [ ] **Who it's for**: Solo creators overwhelmed by posting to multiple platforms
- [ ] **The invitation**: For those who resonate with this solution
- [ ] **No pressure** - just sharing what exists

### Message 2: Additional Context
- [ ] **Case study/results**, OR
- [ ] **Why I built this** (solved my own problem), OR
- [ ] **Gentle reminder** about availability
- [ ] **Still no pressure or FOMO**

### Hold Loosely to Agenda
- [ ] **Relationship over conversion** - not pushing immediate purchase
- [ ] **No artificial timeline** for decision
- [ ] **Comfortable with "not for me" responses**
- [ ] **Trust that right people will say yes when ready**

## Content-Specific: Post to 9 Platforms PRO

### Demonstrates Core Value Proposition
- [ ] **Shows the "before"**: tedious manual posting to multiple platforms
- [ ] **Shows the "after"**: upload to folder → automated posting
- [ ] **Specific about platforms**: Which 9 platforms? (be clear)
- [ ] **Realistic about effort**: What IS still required vs. what's automated?

### Honest About What It Is
- [ ] **It IS**: Publishing automation for existing content
- [ ] **It's NOT**: Content creation tool (that's future offer)
- [ ] **It solves**: Time drain from repetitive manual posting
- [ ] **It doesn't solve**: Creating content strategy or content itself

### Use Cases & Examples
- [ ] **Relatable scenarios**: pottery maker posting studio shots, wedding dress designer, hiking blogger
- [ ] **Real results**: "Upload video → 9 platforms in X minutes"
- [ ] **Practical applications**: When this workflow makes sense vs. when it doesn't

### Technical Clarity (Without Overwhelm)
- [ ] **Simple explanation**: Google Drive folder → automation runs → posts everywhere
- [ ] **Key features clear**: AI captions, platform-specific formatting, tracking
- [ ] **Not technical tutorial** (that's in the setup guide, not marketing content)

---

## After Publishing

### Rhythm Check
- [ ] **Sustainable creation pace?** (respecting your 9-5, AuDHD needs, breaks)
- [ ] **Ratio appropriate**: 5-10 educational posts per 1 promotional post
- [ ] **Not overwhelming audience** with too many messages
- [ ] **Space between offers**

### Golden Rule Assessment
- [ ] **How would I feel receiving this content?**
- [ ] **Does it respect my intelligence and time?**
- [ ] **Would this build or erode trust?**
- [ ] **Does it feel light or heavy/pushy?**

### Learning & Evolution
- [ ] **What engagement did this receive?**
- [ ] **Does this tell me about audience alignment?**
- [ ] **What would I do differently?**
- [ ] **How can I serve better next time?**

## Daily Reminder

**Before posting, ask:**
1. Does this focus solely on the publishing automation offer?
2. Am I creating from service or manipulation?
3. Would I want to receive this content?
4. Does it inspire rather than induce fear/anxiety?
5. Am I respecting my audience's sovereignty and intelligence?
